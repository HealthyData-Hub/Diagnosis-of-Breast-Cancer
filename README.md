# Diagnosis of Breast Cancer

![Breast Cancer](https://example.com/breast_cancer_image.png)

## Description

This project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using binary, supervised machine learning. It utilizes a distance-based algorithm, specifically the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project employs a robust 5-fold nested cross-validation technique for model evaluation and hyper-parameter tuning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/diagnosis-of-breast-cancer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd diagnosis-of-breast-cancer`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset is appropriately formatted.
2. Modify the necessary parameters in the script.
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Features

- Diagnosing breast cancer using supervised machine learning.
- Utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- Robust 5-fold nested cross-validation for model evaluation.
- Hyper-parameter tuning to enhance model performance.
